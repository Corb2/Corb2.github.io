                My name is Corbyn Jacobs, and I was born in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. I spent my formative years in
                Hastings, and during my childhood, I was uncertain about my life's aspirations. I didn't have grand
                ambitions like becoming an astronaut or a firefighter.

                As I progressed through high school, I began to feel that the traditional educational path wasn't the
                right fit for me. Consequently, at the age of 17, I made the decision to leave high school and enter the
                workforce on a full-time basis. Over the years, I held various positions, and I was fortunate to secure
                employment with a company that specialized in hydro excavation, civil construction, and directional
                drilling.

                By the time I turned 20, I had obtained the necessary licenses to operate heavy machinery, thanks to the
                opportunities provided by the company that believed in me. My tenure with this company was filled with
                valuable experiences, during which I gained substantial knowledge about infrastructure and heavy
                machinery operation. While I treasured my time in this industry, I harbored a desire for more; I aspired
                to broaden my horizons and not confine my career to a single industry.

                With this aspiration in mind, I took the bold step of re-entering the educational system, determined to
                pursue a degree. Presently, I find myself in the initial year of the Bachelor of Computing Systems
                program, and I am fully committed to completing this degree. My objective is to equip myself with the
                necessary skills and knowledge in the field of computing, allowing me to follow my passion and embark on
                a rewarding career in this domain. I also have a travel bug, my love for traveling and exploring new places runs deep. It's more
                than just a hobby; it's a genuine passion that fills me with excitement. Each journey is like an
                adventure, and it opens my eyes to new cultures, landscapes, and experiences. Traveling breaks the
                monotony of daily life and connects me with the beauty of the world. It's about discovering hidden gems,
                embracing the unexpected, and growing as a person. This love for travel is a story that keeps evolving,
                an endless quest for excitement and new experiences.
